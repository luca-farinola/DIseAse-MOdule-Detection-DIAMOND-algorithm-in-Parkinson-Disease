<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project   

goal is to investigate basic underlying connectivity patterns in protein interaction networks to dive deeper into which proteins are involved in PD. 
Protein associated to PD are taken as seed nodes taken from [MedGen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/10590)
Network diffusion is carried out using [Disease Module Detection (DIAMOnD)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004120)

* file folder contains seed protein and interactome
* Result folder contains Diamond results after 50 and 500 iterations and cytoskape session 
* scripts folder contains .R fonctions to run DIAMOND
